  ApproachAndFollowTargetSDX, Mods:
  =================================
  Add this AI Task to your entity to make it follow, if you match the requirements in param1. It will follow you with a range of a few blocks, 
  but won't move to be on top of you.
  
  Param1 can be one of two things: a buff or an item name. If you have a buff that matches, the entity will follow you around. Likewise
  if you are holding an item in your hand that matches it, it will follow you around too. This item can also be a block name.
         
    <property name="AITask-9" value="ApproachAndFollowTargetSDX, Mods" param1="buffBeastMaster"/>
    <property name="AITask-9" value="ApproachAndFollowTargetSDX, Mods" param1="foodRawMeat"/>
    <property name="AITask-9" value="ApproachAndFollowTargetSDX, Mods" param1="hayBaleBlock"/>
  
  
  ApproachAndAttackTargetSDX, Mods:
  =================================
  Add this AI Task to your entity to replace it's vanilla ApproachAndAttackTarget. This behaves much like ApproachAndFollow, with the exception that
  the entity will remain hostile to other things, just not you.
  
  <property name="AITask-4" value="ApproachAndAttackTargetSDX, Mods" param1="EntityAnimalStag,40,EntityPlayer,15,EntityZombie,30" param2="buffBeastMaster"/>
  
  
  FollowOrdersSDX, Mods:
  ======================
  Add this AI Task, to be used with ApproachAndAttackTargetSDX or ApproachAndFollowTarget.  This is a test class that will eventually allow you to give orders
  to your followers.
  
  <property name="AITask-8" value="FollowOrdersSDX, Mods" />
  
  
  
  SetNearestEntityAsTargetSDX, Mods:
  ==================================
  This is an AITarget task to replace the vanilla SetNearestEntityAsTarget. It's mean to stop the entity from attacking its master.
  
  	<property name="AITarget-3" value="SetNearestEntityAsTargetSDX, Mods" param1="EntityAnimalStag,0,EntityPlayer,0,EntityZombie,0" />
